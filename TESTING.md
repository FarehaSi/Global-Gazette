Manual Testing of Features
--------------------------

In addition to user story testing, we conducted extensive manual testing of each feature on the "Global Gazette" website. This testing included:

*   Registration and Login: We tested the registration process, ensuring that users could create accounts successfully. We also verified that users could log in with their credentials.
*   Profile Management: We tested the ability for users to update their profiles, including profile pictures and personal information.
*   Creating and Editing Articles: We verified that users could create and edit articles, including adding images.
